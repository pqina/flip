## Quick Start

If you just want to get on your way, copy the `example` directory and use it a starting point.

This example will automatically initialise Flip counters on the website and can be used with the [presets on the demo site](https://pqina.nl/flip/#presets).

## Setup

For the code snippets below we'll assume it's the `flip.min.css` and `flip.min.js` version and the folder we are uploading to is named `flip`.

Copy the following HTML snippet in the `<head>` of your web page.

```html
<link href="/flip/flip.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then copy the following snippet and place it just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script src="/flip/flip.min.js"></script>
```

Make sure the paths in the above code snippets match the location of the CSS and JS files.

You can now copy past the [presets from pqina.nl/flip/](https://pqina.nl/flip/#presets) to your website and everything should function correctly.
